      # A workspace edit represents changes to many resources managed in the workspace. The edit
      # should either provide `changes` or `documentChanges`. If documentChanges are present
      # they are preferred over `changes` if the client can handle versioned document edits.
      #
      # Since version 3.13.0 a workspace edit can contain resource operations as well. If resource
      # operations are present clients need to execute the operations in the order in which they
      # are provided. So a workspace edit for example can consist of the following two changes:
      # (1) a create file a.txt and (2) a text document edit which insert text into file a.txt.
      #
      # An invalid sequence (e.g. (1) delete file a.txt and (2) insert text into file a.txt) will
      # cause failure of the operation. How the client recovers from the failure is described by
      # the client capability: `workspace.workspaceEdit.failureHandling`
      #

        # Depending on the client capability `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` document changes
        # are either an array of `TextDocumentEdit`s to express changes to n different text documents
        # where each text document edit addresses a specific version of a text document. Or it can contain
        # above `TextDocumentEdit`s mixed with create, rename and delete file / folder operations.
        #
        # Whether a client supports versioned document edits is expressed via
        # `workspace.workspaceEdit.documentChanges` client capability.
        #
        # If a client neither supports `documentChanges` nor `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations` then
        # only plain `TextEdit`s using the `changes` property are supported.
